</ul><h3>Game Summary</h3><p>For this codelab, we'll be using a simple and entertaining game, called&#160;"Lollygagger".&#160;The main game play is to travel along a path, atop a robot, shooting Lollipop "cannonballs" at&#160;the Androids that are lollygagging around. Key features of note are:</p><ul>
<li>Two different Unity scenes, one for the main menu, and one for game play.</li>
<li>Ability to play in &#8220;2D&#8221; mode as well as be able to start in Cardboard mode.</li>
<li>Flinging lollipops to the targets, triggered by touch in 2D mode, or by the trigger on the side of Cardboard in VR mode.</li>
<li>Super flexible and simple game level logic to allow infinite possibilities of hours of Cardboard fun!</li>

          <h1></h1><p>First, let's build and run the non-Cardboard version of the game. &#160;From there, we'll add Cardboard support.</p><h2>Configure Unity</h2><ol start="1">
<li>Start Unity. &#160;If you have not developed an Android application with Unity before, make sure you configure the Android SDK within Unity. &#160;In Unity, click <strong>Preferences &gt; External Tools &gt; Android SDK Location, </strong>then select the folder where you downloaded and unzipped the Android SDK.</li>
<li>Click <strong>File &gt; New Project </strong>and create a new project named &#8216;Lollygagger_cardboard&#8217;. </li>
</ol><h2>Import the game assets</h2><p>Import the sample game scenes and assets into your project:</p><ul>
<li>Click <strong>Assets &gt; Import Package &gt; Custom Package</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <code>lollygagger_step0.unitypackage</code>&#160;file you downloaded</li>
<li>Click <strong>Import</strong>.</li>
</ul><h2>Configure the Android player </h2><ol start="1">
<li>Configure Unity to build an Android application</li>
<li>From the menu: click <strong>File &gt; Build Settings...</strong>
</li>
<li>Select Android in the platform list</li>
<li>Click <strong>Switch Platform</strong>
</li>
<li>Add the game scenes to the build.</li>
<li>In the project explorer, select Assets</li>
<li>Drag and Drop Assets/MainMenu scene to the "Scenes In Build" list within the Build Settings dialog.</li>
<li>Then drag and drop Assets/GameScene scene into the list under MainMenu.</li>
</ol><p><img src="../img/cardboard-unity/img-5.png.gif" style="max-width: 347px"></p><ol start="1">
<li>Configure the Unity player settings</li>
<li>Click Player Settings&#8230; in the Build Settings dialog</li>
<li>Then expand &#8220;Resolution and Presentation&#8221; section by clicking on it.</li>
<li>Set the application default orientation&#160;to Landscape Left. &#160;This is the correct orientation for the application when the phone is in Cardboard.</li>

<li>Expand the &#8220;Other Settings&#8221; section by clicking on it.</li>
<li>Enter a unique Bundle ID, this follows .Net namespace (or Java package) naming rules. &#160;Typically this is of the form: com.&lt;yourcompany&gt;.&lt;appname&gt;</li>

          <h1></h1><p>In this lesson, you&#8217;ll import the Cardboard SDK into the Unity project. &#160;This gives you all the scripts and easy to use prefabs for quickly and easily enabling the game to be played in virtual reality mode.</p><h2>Add the Cardboard SDK to the project</h2><ol start="1">
<li>Unzip the Cardboard SDK if you haven't yet</li>
<li>From the menu in Unity: click <strong>Assets &gt; Import Package &gt; Custom package</strong>
</li>
<li>Select CardboardSDKForUnity.unitypackage</li>
<li>Once the package is opened, Unity presents a list of the files within in the package. &#160;</li>
<li>You can deselect the Demo Scene <em>and</em>&#160;the Legacy/Demo Scene folders, since we won&#8217;t be using it in this exercise.</li>
<li>Click "<strong>Import</strong>"</li>
</ol><p><img src="../img/cardboard-unity/img-9.png" style="max-width: 278px"></p><aside class="special"><p><strong>New to Cardboard?</strong></p>
<p>If you are new to Cardboard, or want to explore it some more, your can create a new Unity project and import the Cardboard SDK <em>including</em>&#160;the demo scene and run it!</p></aside><h2>Add cardboard mode to the main menu scene</h2><p>This step adds the stereo cameras and related scripts which are used by the Cardboard SDK to render the stereoscopic view needed to use Cardboard.</p><ol start="1">
<li>Open the main menu&#160;scene. &#160;In the project explorer, select the Assets folder, and then double click the MainMenu scene.</li>
<li>Select the Main Camera in the Scene hierarchy. </li>
<li>From the menu, click &#160;<strong>Component&#160;&gt; Cardboard &gt; Update Stereo Cameras</strong>. &#160;This does the following:</li>
</ol><ol start="1">
<li>Adds the StereoController script component (controls the rendering of the stereo effect)</li>
<li>Adds the CardboardHead script component (the &#8220;head&#8221; containing the &#8220;eyes&#8221;)</li>
<li>Creates Left and Right child cameras (aka the &#8220;eyes&#8221;)</li>
<li>Also adds the SkyboxMesh script component (important since we use a skybox background).</li>
</ol><h2>Change the UI to be in world space</h2><p>This step converts the main menu from being mapped to the Screen Space (which is based on the screen dimensions) to be mapped in the World Space (which is based on the 3d coordinates within the scene). &#160;This is done so that the menu rendering can be done by the stereo cameras used by Cardboard.</p><ol start="1"><li>Select <strong>Canvas </strong>from the <strong>Hierarchy </strong>window, then in the inspector panel:</li></ol><ul><li>Change Render Mode to World space</li></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Change position to (0, 0, 750)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Change Width and Height to 640 and 480</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;pivot = &#160;(.5, .5)</p><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Change scale to (1, 1, 1)</p><p><img src="../img/cardboard-unity/img-10.png" style="max-width: 312px"></p><ol start="2"><li>Associate the Main Camera with the Canvas. &#160;This is done so that UI events can be translated from the screen coordinates to the world coordinates. </li></ol><ul>
<li>Click on the <strong>Canvas</strong>&#160;</li>
<li>In the properties inspector, click on the circle control &#160;next to the Event Camera which will bring up the object selection dialog.</li>
<li>Select the Scene tab, then Main Camera object.</li>
</ul><p><img src="../img/cardboard-unity/img-11.png" style="max-width: 253px"></p><ol start="3"><li>Check the menu location and size. &#160;You can do this by clicking on the Game tab in the scene editor. &#160;You should see:</li></ol><p><img src="../img/cardboard-unity/img-12.png" style="max-width: 405px"></p><h2>Add the Cardboard mode button to the menu</h2><p>In this step, we add a button to the menu that will turn on and off "Cardboard Mode". In cardboard mode the stereoscopic rendering is done, in non-cardboard mode it is the normal 2D rendering. Just to make everything easy, we have made a prefab button.</p><ol start="1">
<li>Find the cardboardButton prefab in the project explorer. &#160;This is under Assets/Prefabs.</li>
<li>In the Hierarchy panel, expand the Canvas object and the Panel object. </li>
<li>Drag and drop the cardboardButton prefab onto the Panel object in the hierarchy. When you are done, the hierarchy should look like:</li>
</ol><p><img src="../img/cardboard-unity/img-13.png" style="max-width: 206px"></p><p>Next, we'll write the script that will run when the button is clicked.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><h3></h3>

<li>Open the game scene. &#160;In the project explorer, select the Assets folder, and the double click the GameScene scene.</li>
<li>Select the Main Camera in the Scene hierarchy. Since the game play is in first person, the main camera is a child object of the player.</li>
