There are three different entry points to GCE, all of which talk to our API:</p><ol start="1">
<li>The command-line interface (CLI), using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/">Cloud SDK</a>
</li>
<li>The Web UI, which you can access through the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Developers Console</a>
</li>
<li>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/reference/latest/">API</a>&#160;directly, (simply HTTP/JSON with client libraries in many different languages) which you can call from your code</li>
</ol><p><img src="../img/computing-the-cosmos/img-4.png" style="max-width: 773px"></p><p>Your VMs are accessible through an assigned External IP&#160;Address, and they easily talk to each other via a local private network. Talking between VMs this way is FAST. We'll set up a default firewall for you, or you can configure your own. You can even create multiple network configurations with various firewall rules to suit your needs and security.</p><p>Your VMs can access storage on mountable Persistent Disks and in Google Cloud Storage.&#160;We'll cover this in more depth later.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>In this step, you learned:</p><ul>
<li>What's provided by the Google Compute Engine service</li>
<li>The three ways to access Google Compute Engine:&#160;the CLI, the API and the Web UI.</li>

When creating resources like Persistent Disks in Google Cloud Platform, you must specify a '<a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones">zone</a>' which is indicates where the resources live, giving you control over where your data is stored and used. To attach a disk to an instance, both resources must reside in the same zone. </p><p>&#8594; In a terminal window on the command-line, run the following command to create a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/">disk</a>&#160;named "disk1" in zone "us-central1-f":</p><pre>gcloud compute disks create disk1 --size 800GB --zone us-central1-f</pre><h3>Create VM Instance</h3><p>Now you're going to create a VM instance using the "compute instances create" command. You'll specify the VM Image "codelab-image" that we just created in the previous step. You'll also enable the Compute Engine instance to have permission to read/write to the Cloud Storage and Cloud Storage APIs using the "--scopes" flag. Finally you'll attach "disk1" (the disk you just created) to the VM Instance using the "--disk" flag.</p><p>&#8594; On a terminal command-line run the following command to create a VM instance named "codelab-node":</p><pre>  gcloud compute instances create \
      codelab-node \
      --zone us-central1-f \
      --image codelab-image \

      --boot-disk-device-name codelab-node \
      --disk name=disk1,device-name=disk1,mode=rw</pre><h3>Summary</h3><p>In this step you created a VM Instance with a custom VM Image along with an attached Persistent Disk. And you enabled the Compute Engine service account so that you can run code on the VM Instance that accesses the Compute Engine and Cloud Storage APIs.</p><h3>Next Up</h3><p>Let's take our new VM Instance for a spin and use it to run some Python code to call the Compute Engine API.</p>

<li>Perform the OAuth 2.0 flow for you, and save the refresh token</li>
<li>Allow you to use the refresh token to request an access token</li>

Execute the makeCoaddCloud.py&#160;script to process the JSON in our tile assignment and generate an image. Run the following command:</p><pre>python makeCoaddCloud.py tile-assignment.json --maxImages=20</pre><aside class="special"><p><strong>Note</strong>: Start with --maxImages=20, increasing by 5 until it successfully completes, if it still fails abandon this tile and go back and perform Step 13 to get assigned a new tile. If you want to include all images associated with your tile assignment you can run the command without the --maxImages flag but be aware that this will require more time for processing.</p></aside><p>&#8594; 2. Find out the image filename for your newly created image by listing the contents of your current directory. Run the following command:</p><pre>ls -l</pre><ul><li>You should see an image listed. It will be named something like "48433.png".</li></ul><p><img src="../img/computing-the-cosmos/img-11.png" style="max-width: 624px"></p><p>&#8594; 3. Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket in your project to host your image for viewing in a web browser. You'll use the Cloud Storage command-line utility called 'gsutil' to accomplish this task, which is included in the Cloud SDK.</p><p>&#160;Run the following command to create a Cloud Storage bucket:</p><ul><li>Replace PROJECT_ID in the command with your Project ID from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Developers Console</a>&#160;so that "viewing-images-PROJECT_ID" looks like "viewing-images-your-project-id" :</li></ul><pre>gsutil mb gs://viewing-images-PROJECT_ID</pre><p>&#8594; 4. Copy the composite image file you just created to a Google Cloud Storage bucket in your project. Run the following command:</p><ul>
<li>Replace '&lt;image-filename&gt;' with the image filename for the image created when you ran the makeCoaddCloud.py command above</li>
<li>Replace PROJECT_ID in the command with your Project ID from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Developers Console</a>&#160;so that "gs://viewing-images-PROJECT_ID" looks like "gs://viewing-images-your-project-id" </li>
</ul><pre>gsutil cp &lt;image-filename&gt; gs://viewing-images-PROJECT_ID</pre><p>&#8594; 5. Make the image public. Run the following command:</p><ul>
<li>Update "gs://viewing-images-PROJECT_ID" to include your project's actual Project ID from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Developers Console</a>&#160;so that it looks like "gs://viewing-images-your-project-id"</li>
<li>Replace '&lt;image-filename&gt;' with the image filename for the image created when you ran the makeCoaddCloud.py command above</li>
</ul><pre>gsutil acl set public-read gs://viewing-images-PROJECT_ID/&lt;image-filename&gt;</pre><p>&#8594; 6. View the image in a web browser. Open a browser and go to the following URL:</p><ul>
<li>Update "viewing-images-PROJECT_ID" to include your project's actual Project ID from the <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/">Developers Console</a>&#160;so that looks like "viewing-images-your-project-id"</li>
<li>Replace '&lt;image-filename&gt;' with the image filename for the image created when you ran the makeCoaddCloud.py command above</li>
</ul><pre>http://storage.googleapis.com/viewing-images-PROJECT_ID/&lt;image-filename&gt;</pre><h3>Summary</h3><p>You used the makeCoaddCloud.py Python script to interact with the LSST Software Stack in order to process a tile assignment into a final composite image. Then you copied the composite image to Cloud Storage. Finally you viewed the image you created in a browser.</p>
